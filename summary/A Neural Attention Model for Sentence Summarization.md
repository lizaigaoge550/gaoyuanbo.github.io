## A Neural Attention Model for Sentence Summarization

运用基于attention 的encoder 以及 合并beam-search decoder还有一些额外的特征去建模

### 贡献
 (1) using a neural summarization model as opposed to a count-based noisy-channel model 
 
 (2) training the model on much larger scale (25K compared to 4 million articles) 
 
 (3) allowing fully abstractive decoding
