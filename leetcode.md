## 485 Max Consecutive Ones
```
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```
## 216 Combination Sum III
```
Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.
Example 1:

Input: k = 3, n = 7

Output:

[[1,2,4]]
```
## 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
```
Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

For example, given the array [2,3,1,2,4,3] and s = 7,
the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```
##  80 Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II
```
Given sorted array nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.
```
## Palindromic Substrings
```
Input: "aaa"
Output: 6
Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
```
## 523  Continuous Subarray Sum
```
Input: [23, 2, 6, 4, 7],  k=6
Output: True
Explanation: Because [23, 2, 6, 4, 7] is an continuous subarray of size 5 and sums up to 42.
```
## 467. Unique Substrings in Wraparound String
```
Input: "zab"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are six substrings "z", "a", "b", "za", "ab", "zab" of string "zab" in the string s.
```
## 413. Arithmetic Slices
```
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

return: 3, for 3 arithmetic slices in A: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 3, 4] itself.

```
##  473. Matchsticks to Square
```
Input: [3,3,3,3,4]
Output: false

Explanation: You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks.
```
## 207. Course Schedule
```
2, [[1,0]]
2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
```
## 93. Restore IP Addresses
```
Given "25525511135",

return ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"]. (Order does not matter)
```
## 131. Palindrome Partitioning
```
For example, given s = "aab",
Return

[
  ["aa","b"],
  ["a","a","b"]
]
```
